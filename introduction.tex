\chapter{History of Tomb Raider Level Editors}
\section{Back to 2000: \emph{Tomb Raider Level Editor} \index{Tomb Raider Level Editor}\index{TRLE}}
Tomb Raider marked a sensational new approach to 3rd person gaming. Fans not only fell in love with Lara and her moves, but with the imaginative and intriguing worlds of her adventures. It all started with Lara's visit to some Egyptian ruins back in 1996, and now with the release of the Tomb Raider Level Editor has come full circle, offering a different sort of adventure in another Egyptian setting. \emph{Tomb Raider Chronicles} marks the end of the line of Tomb Raider games made with these development tools; but rather than viewing this as an end, the release of the editor makes it seem more like a beginning...
\par The \textbf{Tomb Raider Level Editor (TRLE)} includes a tutorial that will walk you through the basics needed to create your own stand alone Tomb Raider levels (but please read the legal disclaimer about commercial use of this product). Even though you will not be able to edit objects or animations (that means Lara’s outfits), you have a wonderful variety of object sets from which to choose. You can sculpt and design on many different ‘levels’ – trigger events, create awe-inspiring spaces, simple to complex…and as you experiment you will learn more about what can be done, and quite possibly discover new methods of applying the knowledge you have acquired.
\par We sincerely hope you will enjoy inventing, designing, and building with and for Lara as much as we have over the past 4 years. We thank all those who have held the enthusiasm for the Tomb Raider series, thereby contributing to its success. We wish you happy adventuring with Lara and the tools used to create her worlds.
